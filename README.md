🍕 Pizza Sales Intelligence Dashboard: Revenue, Orders & Product Performance Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze a full year of pizza sales performance—covering revenue, order trends, category breakdowns, size contributions, and best/worst selling products.

The Pizza Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales and operational metrics for a pizza business across 12 months. It enables stakeholders to monitor revenue, evaluate product performance, analyze demand patterns, and identify key drivers of sales growth.

The dashboard was created using:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for data visualization
• 🔄 Power Query – Data cleaning, shaping, and transformation
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures for AOV, pizza/size/category sales, and YoY trends
• 🧩 Data Modeling – Fact-sales table connected to pizza details (category, size, and time)
• 📁 Source Format – .pbix dashboard file and .png visual exports

Source: Retail Pizza Sales Dataset (Jan 2015 – Dec 2015)

Dataset includes:
• Order-level revenue
• Pizza size & category
• Daily & monthly sales trends
• Product-level performance (top/bottom sellers)
• Order quantities & total pizza sold
• Time-based behavior (weekday & monthly trends)

• Business Problem

The pizza retail business needs to identify which products drive revenue, the best times for sales, customer ordering patterns, and underperforming pizzas that require attention.

Key questions include:
✔ Which pizzas generate the highest revenue?
✔ Which months and weekdays see peak demand?
✔ Which pizza size or category performs best?
✔ What products should be promoted or discontinued?

Without a consolidated dashboard, answering these questions is slow and data-heavy.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a unified analytical tool that:
• Highlights top & bottom performing pizzas
• Reveals customer purchase patterns by day, month, size, and category
• Supports managers in planning menu strategies, staffing, and promotions
• Helps identify best-selling items and optimize inventory
• Increases revenue through data-backed decision-making

• Business Impact & Insights
1. Revenue Optimization

Chicken-based pizzas and large-sized pizzas are the biggest revenue drivers — invest in expanding premium chicken & classic varieties.

2. Menu Engineering

Poor-performing pizzas (Brie Carre, Spinach Pesto) should be re-evaluated for pricing, marketing, or removal.

3. Demand Forecasting

Peak periods:

Fridays & Saturdays

June & July
Staffing, marketing, and inventory must be aligned with weekend & summer demand patterns.

4. Customer Behavior

Customers prefer large pizzas, possibly indicating family/group orders — promotions on combos can increase sales.

5. Operational Planning

Mid-year and weekend spikes require tightening food preparation, delivery efficiency, and raw material stocking.
